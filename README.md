### related to code

<!-- ### related to code

Ans is always consideted trashed

z is always considered trashed -->

archiving is good for big programs since it saves a lot of memory but it sucks for small onces since unarchiving and then archiving takes time

the compiler (the .py file) will attempt to archive what it consideres big files if the flag is not set

also note that archiving WILL mess with Ans

### generic

list names are limited to 5 characters

labels can be up to 2 chars long

you can use 2nd and the up and down arrows to control brightness

you can get the hex code of a command by adding it to the beginning of a program (and comparing a code that you already know)

lower case letters take 2 bytes while upper case letters take only 1 byte

###### strings

using Ans is faster than using the STR variables

appending and inserting (at beginning) a single char to string seems to take an equal amount of time

appending/inserting to STR vars is 50% slower compared to appending/inserting to Ans

appending is MMAAAAYYYBEEEE a bit faster (much less than a second)
