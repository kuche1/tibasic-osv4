## notes

<!-- ### related to code

Ans is always consideted trashed

z is always considered trashed -->

### generic

list names are limited to 5 characters

labels can be up to 2 chars long

you can use 2nd and the up and down arrows to control brightness

you can get the hex code of a command by adding it to the beginning of a program (and comparing a code that you already know)

###### strings

using Ans is faster than using the STR variables

appending and inserting (at beginning) a single char to string seems to take an equal amount of time

appending/inserting to STR vars is 50% slower compared to appending/inserting to Ans

appending is MMAAAAYYYBEEEE a bit faster (much less than a second)
